## Bot Architecture & Working Mechanism

The Advanced Telegram Bot is built with a modular architecture that emphasizes scalability, reliability, and security. Here’s a deep dive into its working mechanism:

### Core Components

- **Command Handlers:**  
  Each bot command is managed by a dedicated handler that validates user input, processes the request, and returns formatted responses. Handlers leverage asynchronous programming (via `asyncio`) to provide non-blocking operations.

- **Timeout & Retry Mechanisms:**  
  Commands have built-in timeout decorators (20 seconds for most commands, 3 minutes for batch processing) to ensure the bot remains responsive. Exponential backoff strategies handle transient network failures gracefully.

- **API Integration:**  
  The bot integrates with blockchain APIs (e.g., blockchain.info) to fetch real-time data such as Bitcoin balances, transaction counts, and public keys. Randomized browser headers are used to mimic standard web requests and reduce load on external services.

- **Batch Processing Engine:**  
  For commands like `/list`, the bot processes large batches of Bitcoin addresses, providing live progress updates to users. This ensures that even when handling hundreds of addresses, the user is kept informed of the operation’s status.

- **Background Tasks:**  
  A scheduled background job automatically polls RSS feeds for crypto news and broadcasts new headlines to active users and community channels, ensuring that subscribers receive the latest updates without manual intervention.
